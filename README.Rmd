An R package to easily insert humanitarian web icons into rmarkdown.

It works with inline code `` `r '\x60r humicons::humicon_rmd("Agriculture")\x60'` `` and chunks:

````
```{r, eval=FALSE}
humicons::humicon_rmd("Agriculture")
```
````

The **development** version can be installed from GitHub using:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_gitlab("dickoa/humicons")
```

This package is a fork of the `icon` package by `ropensci`: https://github.com/ropenscilabs/icon
